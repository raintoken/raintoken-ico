## RainCheck History
RainCheck was formed in November 2014 to enable online-to-offline (O2O) commerce. Created to influence and measure the high level of online product discovery/research and to connect those findings with the corresponding in-store sales transaction. We also offer card-linking where people can add offers, loyalty points or cash-back to any debit or credit payment card, replacing the loyalty card. Our award winning patent pending IP states that we can do this at SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) level, not just at the merchant level.

## RainCheck Loyalty Platform
The RainCheck Platform, when fully developed, will aim to provide a decentralised platform through which token holders will be able to manage and aggregate reward points across multiple loyalty schemes. To enable this, RainCheck plans to provide consumers with the option to combine reward points from multiple loyalty schemes into one digital unit, the RAIN Token.

## RAIN Token
The RAIN Token has been created to carry out a transfer mechanism on the RainCheck Commerce Platform. This token is based on the Stellar protocol, which was specially designed to enable micro-payments that can handle very fast transactions at very low cost.
